# sofia-sensors

The project uses Mapbox GL JS for visualizing sensor data in Sofia. The code incorporates a Mapbox API key for initializing the map.

The project includes the following functionalities:

Map and Layers:

Creation of an interactive map with the option to switch between vector and satellite basemaps.
Ability to add and remove various map layers.
Graphs:

Visualization of sensor data in the form of graphs.
Option to select a sensor and a time interval for visualization.
Map Interaction:

Detection of double-clicking on the map.
Visualization of points on the map representing different sensors.
Data Loading:

Loading geographic data from various sources (sensors, geo-objects like metro stations and bus stops).
Layer and Time Interval Selection:

Selection of different layers (temperature, NO2, SO2, humidity, etc.) for map visualization.
Selection of a time interval for data analysis.
Heatmap:

Option to show and hide a heatmap on the map.
Selection of blur and opacity for the heatmap.
Layer Visibility Check:

Displaying a warning if the user tries to change the layer while a visible layer exists.
Updating the graph for the selected sensor:

Updating the graph when selecting a different sensor.
The project works with geographic data and provides opportunities for the visualization and analysis of sensor information in Sofia.
